#so this is a pretty simple application
#that shows my selection of prefered
#games. there really isn't anyhting special
#about it nor is ir 100% practical.

#the file used to start the CLI.
#the game file then runs the cli file
#located in the lib directory. From there 
#the cli uses the scrapper file to pull the
